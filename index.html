        <h3 id="text">About for the Cofee Time Cafe!!!!!</h3>
        The Coffee Time is more than just a cafe; it's a community hub and a coffee laboratory all rolled into one.
        The journey began in the back of a 1969 VW bus, bringing a unique coffee experience to wherever their wheels took them.
         After a couple of years as a mobile cafe, they found a quaint space in an unassuming street in Chinatown, with 
         a view of the cable cars passing by. This small cafe has now become a beloved gathering spot for the community and a 
         hidden gem for coffee aficionados seeking some of the finest coffee from roasters around the globe..Since then, The 
         Coffee Time has expanded, opening a second shop and assembling a team dedicated to mastering the art
         of coffee and advocating for a culture of caring.
